	<h1>Hi. I'm Eric S. Londres.</h1>
	<p>I'm an enthusiast of many things.</p>

	<p>
	    I consider myself a programmer by career. You can see some of the code
	    I've witten on <a href="https://GitLab.com/slondr">my GitLab page</a>;
	    a few of my projects are also mirrored on
	    <a href="https://GitHub.com/slondr">GitHub</a>. I'm currently in my
	    third of four years as an undergraduate student at Stevens Institute
	    of Technology.
	</p>

	<p>
	    I'm also an avid fan of
	    <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/~slondr">music</a> and
	    <a href="https://letterboxd.com/slondr/">films</a>. I play bass
	    guitar in my band, and have produced short films and other videos
	    for both my personal YouTube channel and for
	    <a href="https://www.sittv.org/">SITTV</a>, Stevens's television
	    studio and film club; I was the president of SITTV from March 2019
	    to March 2020.
	</p>

	<p>
	    I spend a great deal of my free time writing. I occasionally post
	    on <a href="https://blog.ericlondr.es/">my blog</a>, but more often
	    I am contributing articles or opinion pieces to
	    <a href="https://thestute.com/author/elondres/">The Stute</a>, Stevens's
	    student-run newspaper.
	</p>

	<p>If you'd like to get in contact with me, I'd prefer you use
	    <a href="https://t.me/slondr">Telegram</a>. If you aren't on Telegram
	    (and you should be!), I'm also reachable on Matrix as
	    <code>@slondr:matrix.org</code>, or
	    <a href="mailto:ericlondres@outlook.com">via email</a>.
