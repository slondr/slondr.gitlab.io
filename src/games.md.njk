Right from this website, you can play [a text-based adventure game about Stevens](/Burger) that I wrote (but forgot to submit) for a Game Jam in 2017. It was never fully finished, but is technically playable from intro to credits. I completed a [much smaller, yet fully finished, spiritual successor](/Sleep) for a similar Game Jam in 2019.

My first non-Inform-based game was completed for a later Game Jam and was written in fully POSIX C. [You can view the source code on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/slondr/win-simulator) â€” a major priority of mine during the project was writing correct code using canonical practices.
