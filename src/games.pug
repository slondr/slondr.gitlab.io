				| Right from this website, you can play 
				a(href='/Burger') a text-based adventure game about Stevens 
				| that I wrote (but forgot to submit) for a Game Jam in 2017. It was never fully finished, but is technically playable from intro to credits. I completed a

				| My first non-Inform-based game was completed for a later Game Jam and was written in fully POSIX C. Titled

				a(href='https://gitlab.com/slondr/win-simulator') you can view the source code on GitLab 
				| â€” a major priority of mine during the project was writing correct code using canonical practices.
