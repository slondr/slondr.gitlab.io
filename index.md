# I'm Eric S. Londres.

I'm an undergraduate student at Stevens Institute of Technology and  <a href="https://gitlab.com/slondr">a programmer by trade</a>. I also enjoy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5o62RNnvTBYlFZhJVmV0XQ">making videos</a> in my spare time, as well as <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/slondr">gaming</a>.

I currently hold the position of Director of Deliverables for <a href="https://www.sittv.org">SITTV</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/SITTV">Stevens's television station</a>. I occasionaly write and edit articles for <a href="http://thestute.com/">The Stute</a>, Stevens's newspaper. I'm also a member of the Alpha Phi Omega national service fraternity's [Theta Alpha chapter](https://apota.org), where I presently serve as Webmaster.

I somewhat maintain [a blog](/blog) on this website, where I periodically post about technology or anything that crosses my mind.

I've also dabbled in game development. Right from this website, you can play [a text-based adventure game about Stevens](/Burger) that I wrote (but forgot to submit) for a Game Jam in 2017. It was never fully finished, but is technically playable from intro to credits. I completed a [much smaller, yet fully finished, spiritual successor](/Sleep) for a similar Game Jam in 2019.

If you'd like to get in contact with me, [shoot me an email](mailto:ericlondres@outlook.com) or hit me up on <a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-londres-153239171). I'm usually more responsive to the former. If you'd like to send me an encrypted email, you can find my public key [here](/pubkey).
